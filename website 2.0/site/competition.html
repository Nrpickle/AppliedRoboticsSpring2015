    <h3>Competition Introduction
  </h3>  
  <p>This year, the competition is a variant of beer-pong, involving robot-players interacting with human controllers. They preform in a semi-autonomous beer pong competition against other robots. There are many different factors  that play into making this competition challenging, not the least of which is that the final competition venue is to take place outside.

  <h3>Competition Rules</h3>
  </p>
  <p>The rules are described below. </p>
  <p>They are current as of 4/23/2015.</p>
  <p>
    <h4>Competition Structure</h4>
  </p>
  <p>3 seeding matches and initial project evaluation will be held on Tuesday of Dead Week.  The results of these initial matches will be used to make a balanced bracket for the final tournament held during Finals Week.  Traditionally over 50% of the teams have their projects fully functional by Dead Week, but the Dead Week evaluations give the struggling teams insight into how to prioritize their efforts to maximize their grade improvement for performance during the public demonstration.</p>
  <p>
  <h4>Scoring of seeds competition</h4>
  </p>
  <p>Each match will be scored as a win or loss and also a cup differential.  The seeds for the final tournament will be decided first by the number of wins and then ties broken by the total cup differential.  Ties after total cup differential will be broken by coin toss.</p>
  <p>
    <h4>Equipment for the match</h4>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>8' x 2' x 27.5&quot; Table</li>
    <li>36 Ping Pong Balls (18 per team)</li>
    <li>12 Red Solo Cups, 16 Ounces in size (6 cups per team)</li>
    <li>48 Ounces of water (4 ounces per cup)</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <h4>
      Cup Setup
    </h4>
  </p>
  <p>The cups will be set up 3-2-1 from the back to front.  The pyramid base will be aligned with the end of the table, and centered right to left (+/- 1").  The pyramid will be reformed when there are 3 cups and 1 cup remaining.  Cups will initially be touching each other, but they might shift during the match.  Cups will not be 'tightened up' if they shift during the match, until the pyramid is reformed at 3 or 1 cup.</p>
  <p>
    <h4>Starting the Game</h4>
  </p>
  <p>Possession or side is chosen by the winner of a coin toss during the seeding matches.  The loser of the coin toss decides the option not selected by the coin toss winner.  Possession and side are chosen by the higher ranked team during the final tournament.</p>
  <p>
    <h4>Playing the Game</h4>
  </p>
  <p>The robot will have 15 seconds to assess game state and finish the throw. A throw that lands inside a cup will cause that cup to be removed.  A bounce throw that lands inside a cup will cause that cup and a bonus cup chosen by the throwing team to be removed.  Bounce shots may be swatted by the defending team.  Swatting or interfering with a ball that has not hit the table or cup will incur a 1 cup penalty. Contacting a cup while trying to swat will incur a 2 cup penalty.  The team with no remaining cups loses the match.</p>
  <p>
    <h4>Equal Turns</h4>
  </p>
  <p>Each team will be guaranteed an equal number of turns.  This can cause a tie if both teams sink 6 straight non-bounce shots.  Regular match ties will go into a special tie-breaking lightning round.  </p>
  <p>
    <h4>Lightning Round</h4>
  </p>
  <p>The cups on both sides of the board will initially be set up as a 3-cup pyramid.  The higher ranked team will fire three balls within 15 seconds to try and score as many cups as possible.  The highest score in the lightning round is 6 points, for three bounce shots.  Swats are allowed for lightning round shots that bounce.  The lower ranked team will then be given 15 seconds to make as many points as they can in 15 seconds with 3 balls.  In event of a lightning round tie, the lightning round will repeat with two additional balls.</p>
  <p>
    <h4>Robot Restrictions  </h4>
  </p>
  <p><strong style="font-size: .9em;">Size</strong>:  The robot must fit within the space normally taken by a human.  77" from the floor, 24" wide, and 24" long.  The swatting mechanism must target a specific ball.  During the lightning round, any interference on a non-bounced ball will be counted as a faulty swat.  Please discuss this rule with TAs if you have concerns.
<br><br>
<strong style="font-size: .9em;">Setup Time</strong>:  The robot must be able to be setup at a new table within 10 minutes and start playing a match.  1 cup will be removed for every minute over 10 minutes used in the preparation of the match at the discretion of the referees. </p>
  <p>
    <h4>Controlling the Robot
  </h4>
  </p>
  <p>Robots may be controlled from a remote control area that is visually separated from the playing tables. Robot controllers may use a commercially available video stream to get information about the game state and issue commands to the robot.  Note that the video stream will have a significant delay and there will be a delay in the transmission of commands to the robot.  This will not be a viable option to detect quick operations, such as swatting.  Remote control will allow for shot selection, compensation for wind, and other functions at the discretion of the team, with the precaution that only 15 seconds total will be allowed for each shot from the time signalled by the arbiter.</p>
  <p>
    <h4>Final Decisions  </h4>
  </p>
  <p>Referees have the final say in the interpretation and implementation of the rules during project evaluation and the competition.</p>
