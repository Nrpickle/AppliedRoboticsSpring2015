  <h3> Course Introduction </h3>
  
  Robots are devices that can sense their environment, reason about the acquired information, and act on their environment. This course is a multidisciplinary hardware project design experience in which small teams of electrical and computer engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science students deliver an end-of-course demonstration of a final robotic system. Throughout the semester, the students configure, design, implement, test and evaluate in the laboratory a succession of mechatronic devices and subsystems culminating in the final integrated system. Lectures during the first half of the quarter will complement the laboratory experience with comparative surveys, operational principles, integrated design issues, and brainstorming associated with the spectrum of mechanism, electronics, and control components. Lecture coverage includes information needed to complete the main project: mechanisms, motors, motor drives, sensors, interface circuits, microcontroller programming, and control.
